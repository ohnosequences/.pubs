    abstract = {A functor T: A â†’ B is said to be conservative if it reflects isomorphisms: that is, any morphism f of A with Tf invertible is itself invertible. We are interested here in those functors which, like the forgetful functors of algebra, are conservative and have left adjoints. Such functors "nearly" enjoy a variety of good properties, in the sense that they do so under more-or-less mild completeness or cocompleteness conditions on A. Our aim in this note is to give such conditions on A which are as weak as we can make them.},
