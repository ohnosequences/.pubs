    abstract = {Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have revolutionized genomic research. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing using paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq platform from Illumina, Inc., is being used to characterize the composition and dynamics of extremely complex/diverse microbial communities. For this analysis on the Illumina platform, merging and quality filtering of paired-end reads are essential first steps in data analysis to ensure the accuracy and reliability of downstream analysis.},
