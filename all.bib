    abstract = {Many problems lead to the consideration of "algebras", given by an object A of a category A together with "actions" T: A → A on A of one or more endofunctors of A, subjected to equational axioms. Such problems include those of free monads and free monoids, of cocompleteness in categories of monads and of monoids, of orthogonal subcategories (= generalized sheaf-categories), of categories of continuous functors, and so on; apart from problems involving the algebras for their own sake.

Desirable properties of the category of algebras - existence of free ones, cocompleteness, existence of adjoints to algebraic functors - all follow if this category can be proved reflective in some well-behaved category: for which we choose a certain comma-category T/k.

We show that the reflexion exists and is given as the colimit of a simple transfinite sequence, if A is cocomplete and the T_k preserve either colimits or unions of suitably-long chains of subobjects.

The article draws heavily on the work of earlier authors, unifies and simplifies this, and extends it to new problems. Moreover the reflectivity in T/k is stronger than any earlier result, and will be applied in forthcoming articles, in an enriched version, to the study of categories with structure.},

    abstract = {T cells and B cells are essential in the adaptive immunity via expressing T cell receptors and immunoglogulins respectively for recognizing antigens. To recognize a wide variety of antigens, a highly diverse repertoire of receptors is generated via complex recombination of the receptor genes. Reasonably, frequencies of the recombination events have been shown to predict immune diseases and provide insights into the development of immunity. The field is further boosted by high-throughput sequencing and several computational tools have been released to analyze the recombined sequences. However, all current tools assume regular recombination of the receptor genes, which is not always valid in data prepared using a RACE approach. Compared to the traditional multiplex PCR approach, RACE is free of primer bias, therefore can provide accurate estimation of recombination frequencies. To handle the non-regular recombination events, a new computational program is needed.},

    abstract = {Accurate characterization of the repertoire of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains is critical to understanding adaptive immunity. Such characterization has many applications across such fields as vaccine development and response, clone-tracking in cancer, and immunotherapy. Here we present a new methodology called single-cell TCRseq (scTCRseq) for the identification and assembly of full-length rearranged V(D)J T-cell receptor sequences from paired-end single-cell RNA sequencing reads. The method allows accurate identification of the V(D)J rearrangements for each individual T-cell and has the novel ability to recover paired alpha and beta segments. Source code is available at                   https://github.com/ElementoLab/scTCRseq                                  .},

    abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR) genes is a powerful tool for analyses of antigen specificity, clonality and diversity of T lymphocytes. Here, we developed a new TCR repertoire analysis method using 454 DNA sequencing technology in combination with an adaptor-ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This method allows the amplification of all TCR genes without PCR bias. To compare gene usage, diversity and similarity of expressed TCR repertoires among individuals, we conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of TRA and TRB genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 healthy human individuals.},

    abstract = {In both immunoglobulins (Ig) and T cell receptors (TCR), the rearrangement of V, D, and J region sequence elements during lymphocyte maturation creates an enormous degree of diversity in an area referred to as the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) loop. Variations in the particular V, D, and J elements used, precise points of recombination, and random nucleotide addition all lead to extensive length and sequence heterogeneity. CDR3 loops are often critical for antigen binding in Igs and appear to provide the principal peptide binding residues in TCRs. To better understand the physical and selective constraints on these sequences, we have compiled information on CDR3 size variation for Ig H, L (kappa and lambda) and TCR alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Ig H and TCR delta CDR3s are the most variable in size and are significantly longer than L and gamma chains, respectively. In contrast, TCR alpha and beta chain distributions are highly constrained, with nearly identical average CDR3 lengths, and their length distributions are not altered by thymic selection. Perhaps most significantly, these CDR3 length profiles suggest that gamma/delta TCRs are more similar to Igs than to alpha/beta TCRs in their putative ligand binding region, and thus gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cells may have fundamentally different recognition properties.},
